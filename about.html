    <h1>About Rate My Principal</h1>

    <div class="box">
        <p>
            Rate My Principal was created to give teachers and parents a simple, honest way 
            to share feedback about school leadership and school culture. 
            Our goal is to provide transparency, encourage improvement, and help communities 
            better understand their local schools.

            Reviews are anonymous as long as you avoid including personal identifying details 
            about yourself or anyone else. Please keep comments professional, respectful, and 
            focused on school leadership or school environment — never individuals other than 
            the principal.
        </p>

            This website is a community-driven project and will continue to evolve.  
            More features, filtering options, and school-based tools will be added over time.
