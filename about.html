        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who is this site for?</h3>
            <p>
                This site is mainly for <strong>teachers and school staff</strong> who want to share honest feedback
                about principals and school climate. A separate space for parents may be added in the future.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are reviews really anonymous?</h3>
            <p>
                The site does not ask for your name or email. However, your review can still be identifying if you include
                details that clearly point to you (for example, “the only 7th grade music teacher at this school”).
                To stay more anonymous, keep your comments general and avoid describing yourself in a way that only one
                person fits.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can principals see these reviews?</h3>
            <p>
                Anyone who knows the website link can view reviews, including principals, staff, and the general public.
                Write as if your review could eventually be seen by anyone at the school.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I mention my principal by name?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you may include the principal’s name in the review form since that is who the review is about.
                However, please avoid naming other teachers, staff members, students, or families in your comments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I get in trouble for posting my opinion?</h3>
            <p>
                This site is meant for opinions and experiences, not for threats or harassment. Staying professional,
                focusing on patterns, and avoiding personal attacks or illegal/violent language reduces the risk of issues.
                If you are concerned, keep your comments general and avoid details that clearly identify you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I include in my review?</h3>
            <p>
                Helpful reviews focus on the overall experience working at the school, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication style of the principal</li>
                <li>Support for staff and classroom management</li>
                <li>School climate and morale</li>
                <li>How decisions are made and shared</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I avoid including in my review?</h3>
            <p>Please avoid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Threats, harassment, or abusive language</li>
                <li>Slurs or hate speech</li>
                <li>Accusations of crimes or illegal activity</li>
                <li>Names of teachers, staff, students, or families who are not the principal being reviewed</li>
                <li>Contact information (phone numbers, email addresses, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I edit or delete a review after posting it?</h3>
            <p>
                In this early version of the site, there is no automatic way for users to edit or delete reviews.
                As the site grows and moderation tools are added, a process for requesting changes or removal may be added
                and explained here.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this an official rating from the district or state?</h3>
            <p>
                No. This site is not affiliated with any school district, government agency, or official rating system.
                All content is user-submitted opinion.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if I see a review that crosses the line?</h3>
            <p>
                A “Report review” option may be added to individual reviews to allow users to flag content that violates
                the guidelines. Until then, you can reach out using the contact information on the Contact page (when available)
                if something is clearly abusive or unsafe.
