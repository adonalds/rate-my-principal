    <h1>About Rate My Principal</h1>

    <div class="box">
        <p>
            Rate My Principal was created to give teachers and school staff a simple, honest way 
            to share feedback about school leadership and school culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to provide transparency, encourage improvement, and help educators better
            understand what it is like to work at a particular school under a particular principal.
        </p>
