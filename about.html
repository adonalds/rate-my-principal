        <h1>About Rate My Principal</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                Rate My Principal is a simple, anonymous place for <strong>teachers and school staff</strong>
                to share honest feedback about school leadership and school climate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to help educators understand what it is like to work under a particular principal
                and within a particular school environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                A separate space for parents may be added in the future, but this version is focused on
                the experience of staff working in the building every day.

            <h2>Anonymity and Privacy</h2>
            <div class="notice-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Reviews are anonymous only if <em>you</em> keep them anonymous.
                The site does not ask for your name or email, but what you write could still identify you.
            </div>
            <p>To protect your privacy, please avoid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Describing yourself in a way that clearly points to one person (for example, “the only 7th grade science teacher in the building”).</li>
                <li>Listing exact years and roles if they make you obviously identifiable.</li>
                <li>Including phone numbers, email addresses, or other contact information.</li>
                <li>Naming other teachers, staff members, students, or families in your comments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What to Write</h2>
            <p>Helpful reviews focus on <strong>patterns and behaviors</strong>, not personal attacks. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“The principal communicates expectations clearly and is visible in the building.”</li>
                <li>“Staff input is sometimes requested, but decisions often feel top-down.”</li>
                <li>“The school climate is generally positive, but staff morale has declined over the last few years.”</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Not to Write</h2>
            <p>Please do <strong>not</strong> post:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Threats, harassment, or abusive language</li>
                <li>Slurs or hate speech</li>
                <li>Accusations of illegal activity</li>
                <li>Private information about specific staff, students, or families</li>
                <li>Full names of teachers or students who are <em>not</em> the principal being reviewed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Reviews that clearly violate these guidelines may be removed if moderation tools are added in the future.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Can Someone Figure Out Who I Am?</h2>
            <p>
                No system can guarantee that a review can never be connected to a specific person. Small schools,
                unique roles, or very specific details can make it easier for someone to guess who wrote a review.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are worried about being identified, keep your review focused on <strong>experiences and patterns</strong>,
                not on details that only one person would know.
            </p>
