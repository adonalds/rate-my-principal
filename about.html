        <h1>About Rate My Principal</h1>
        <p>
            Rate My Principal is a simple, anonymous place for <strong>teachers and school staff</strong>
            to share honest feedback about school leadership and school climate.
        </p>

        <h2>Who This Site Is For</h2>
        <p>

            <li>Teachers</li>
            <li>Support staff and other school employees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The goal is to help educators understand what it is like to work under a particular principal
            and within a particular school environment.
        </p>

        <h2>What You Can Review</h2>
        <p>You can share feedback about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The principal’s leadership, communication, and decision-making</li>
            <li>The overall school climate and culture</li>
            <li>How supported staff feel in their roles</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="notice-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Do <u>not</u> include any details that could identify you
            or another individual. Keep comments general and professional.
        </div>

        <h2>Anonymity and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Reviews on this site are meant to be anonymous. The site does not ask for your name,
            email address, or any login information. However, your anonymity also depends on
            what you choose to write.
        </p>
        <p>Please avoid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stating your exact role if it makes you easily identifiable (for example, “the only 7th grade science teacher”)</li>
            <li>Mentioning specific classrooms, years, or other details that clearly point to you</li>
            <li>Including phone numbers, email addresses, or other personal contact information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Write (and What Not to Write)</h2>
        <h3>Helpful examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>“The principal communicates expectations clearly and is visible in the building.”</li>
            <li>“Discipline policies are inconsistent and staff are often left out of the loop.”</li>
            <li>“The school climate is generally positive, but staff morale has declined over the last few years.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Please do not include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Threats or abusive language</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>How Reviews Are Displayed</h2>
        <p>
            When you submit a review, it is tied to the school name, county, state, and principal name
            that you enter. Over time, this will help educators:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search for a specific school and see feedback left by other staff</li>
            <li>Compare overall impressions of leadership and school climate</li>
        </ul>
