        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>Who is this site for?</h3>
            <p>
                This site is mainly for <strong>teachers and school staff</strong> who want to share
                honest feedback about principals and school climate. A separate space for parents
                may be added in the future.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>Are reviews really anonymous?</h3>
            <p>
                The site does not ask for your name or email. However, your review can still identify you
                if you include details that clearly point to one person (for example, “the only 7th grade
                art teacher at this school”). To stay more anonymous, keep your comments general and avoid
                describing yourself in a way that only one person fits.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>Can principals see these reviews?</h3>
            <p>
                Anyone with the link can view reviews, including principals, staff, and the public.
                Write as if your review could eventually be seen by anyone at the school.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>Can I mention my principal by name?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes — the review is specifically about your principal and the school. However, please
                avoid naming <strong>other</strong> teachers, staff, students, or families in your comments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>What should I include in my review?</h3>
            <p>Helpful reviews focus on overall patterns and experiences, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication style of the principal</li>
                <li>Support for staff and classroom decisions</li>
                <li>School climate and staff morale</li>
                <li>How decisions are made and shared</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>What should I avoid including?</h3>
            <p>Please avoid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Threats, harassment, or abusive language</li>
                <li>Slurs or hate speech</li>
                <li>Accusations of crimes or illegal activity</li>
                <li>Names of teachers, staff, students, or families who are not the principal</li>
                <li>Personal contact information (phone numbers, emails, addresses, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>Can I edit or delete a review after posting it?</h3>
            <p>
                In this early version, there is no automatic way for users to edit or delete reviews.
                As the site grows and moderation tools are added, a process for requesting changes or removal
                may be added and explained here.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>Is this an official rating from the district or state?</h3>
            <p>
                No. This site is not affiliated with any school district, government agency, or official
                rating system. All content is user-submitted opinion.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box faq-item">
            <h3>What if I see a review that crosses the line?</h3>
            <p>
                A “Report review” button may be added to each review so users can flag content that violates
                the guidelines. Until then, you can reach out using the contact information on the About page
                if something is clearly abusive or unsafe.
